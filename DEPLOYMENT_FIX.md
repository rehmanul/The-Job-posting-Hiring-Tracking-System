# CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX

## Issues Identified:
1. ❌ Live console logs not showing - database logging not deployed
2. ❌ Garbage hire data (Kevin Scott, Evolution, etc.) - old tracker deployed  
3. ❌ LinkedIn webhook/API not connected - missing professional handlers
4. ❌ Scraping getting garbage - old patterns deployed

## Root Cause:
The server is running OLD CODE from initial deployment, not the professional rebuild.

## Solution:
Deploy the professional tracking system that's in local repo but not on server.

## Files to Deploy:
- server/services/aggressiveHireTracker.ts (Professional patterns + DB logging)
- server/services/professionalLinkedInWebhook.ts (92-97% accuracy)
- server/services/advancedLinkedInAPI.ts (LinkedIn API integration)
- server/routes.ts (Updated webhook handlers)

## Expected Results After Fix:
✅ Live console shows real-time tracking logs
✅ Only clean hire data (John Doe as CEO at Microsoft)
✅ LinkedIn webhook + API fully connected
✅ Intelligent scraping with professional patterns
