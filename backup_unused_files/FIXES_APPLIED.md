# Job Tracker Expert - Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Google Sheets Integration Issues ✅

**Problem**: 
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID` not found error
- Missing `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` environment variable

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=jobtracker-service@jobtracker-expert-447318.iam.gserviceaccount.com` to `.env`
- The Google Sheets ID was already present but service wasn't reading it properly

### 2. Slack Bot Scope Issues ✅

**Problem**: 
- Slack API error: `missing_scope` - needed `chat:write:bot` but provided `incoming-webhook`

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated Slack configuration in `.env` to include both channel formats
- Added `SLACK_CHANNEL=#job-alerts` for better compatibility

**Action Required**: 
- Update Slack bot permissions in Slack App settings to include `chat:write` scope
- Reinstall the Slack app to workspace with new permissions

### 3. LinkedIn Scraping Timeout Issues ✅

**Problem**: 
- Navigation timeouts (30000ms exceeded)
- Selector wait failures
- `net::ERR_ABORTED` errors

**Fix Applied**:
- Reduced timeout from 30s to 15s for navigation
- Changed `waitUntil` from `networkidle2` to `domcontentloaded` for faster loading
- Added fallback selectors and better error handling
- Reduced element processing limits (20→10 jobs, 50→20 hires)
- Re-enabled LinkedIn scraper (was completely disabled)

### 4. Environment Variable Configuration ✅

**Updated `.env` file with**:
```env
GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID=1yrPK6x7vCdodnkMWxHyuWI0vv7H-1xVbg7qMmYkNGXY
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=jobtracker-service@jobtracker-expert-447318.iam.gserviceaccount.com
SLACK_CHANNEL=#job-alerts
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0992TZAS77
```

## Testing

### Test Google Sheets Connection
```bash
node test-sheets.js
```

### Expected Results After Fixes
- ✅ Google Sheets integration should work
- ✅ LinkedIn scraping should have fewer timeouts
- ⚠️ Slack integration needs bot permission update
- ✅ Reduced error logs and better error handling

## Manual Actions Required

### 1. Update Slack Bot Permissions
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Select your Job Tracker app
3. Go to "OAuth & Permissions"
4. Add these scopes:
   - `chat:write`
   - `chat:write.public`
5. Reinstall app to workspace

### 2. Verify Google Sheets Access
1. Ensure the service account email has access to the Google Sheet
2. Share the sheet with: `jobtracker-service@jobtracker-expert-447318.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Give "Editor" permissions

### 3. LinkedIn Rate Limiting
- Consider adding delays between company scans
- Monitor for LinkedIn blocking/captcha challenges
- Use proxy rotation if available

## Performance Improvements Applied

1. **Reduced Timeouts**: 30s → 15s for faster failure detection
2. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks instead of crashes  
3. **Optimized Selectors**: Multiple fallback selectors for robustness
4. **Reduced Batch Sizes**: Smaller processing batches to avoid timeouts
5. **Improved Logging**: More specific error messages for debugging
